### Setup working environment
- This section assumes that you are using the preffered softwares (Visual Studio Code and Bruno)
1. Open VS Code and install the "SQLite Explorer" extension.
2. Create a virtual environment with Python by entering `python -m venv venv` using the corresponding terminal of your OS (Windows - Powershell, MacOS/Linux - Terminal).
3. Activate the virtual environment using `./venv/Scripts/activate` (Windows) or `source venv/bin/activate` (MacOS/Linux).
    - For Windows: If you are receiving an error containing "cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system," enter `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process` first.
5. Install FastAPI module in Python using `pip install "fastapi[standard]"`
    - Make sure to surround `fastapi[standard]` with double quotation marks to ensure that it works on your terminal.
6. Install Peewee module in Python using `pip install peewee`
